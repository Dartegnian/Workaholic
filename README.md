Workaholic is a suite of software that helps your employees get to work on time in a convenient and safe way. Developed during the TANDA Manila 2017 Hackathon, this project is supposed to integrate to TANDA's already existing system for attendance.

## Note
This site is best viewed on a 1366x768 screen and works best with Google Chrome 59. I recommend running the latest version of Windows 10, or at least running Windows 10 version 1703. An experimental flag is also **recommended** to better view this site: **chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features**.

There is a companion Android app, but I currently do not have access to the source code, and the source code may have already been deleted. Either way, I don't have it, so, sorry.
